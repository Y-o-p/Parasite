# Godot Wild Jam
### Theme: Parasite
### Premise: You are a biologically engineered tape worm that feeds off human flesh. Use your elastic capabilities to jump from host to host devouring them.
### Mechanics:
	- Hold LMB to charge your jump attack. Once you release LMB, you will release from your host and fly in the direction of your cursor to another host.
	- You can be inside multiple hosts at the same time.
	- Press spacebar to kill all infected hosts and super fling yourself.
	- As you kill more humans, you become longer.
	- The more humans you kill in one chain the bigger the growth.
### Negative Mechanics:
	- If you fling yourself and don't end up in a new host, you only have one more fling. If you miss again, it's game over.
	- You can run into your own body. Running into yourself does **not** end the game.
	- The humans run around in unpredictable ways. If you connect to too many of them, you can become tangled up and unable to go further.
