# Godot Wild Jam
### Theme: Parasite
### Premise: You are a biologically engineered tape worm that feeds off human flesh. Use your elastic capabilities to jump from host to host devouring them.
### Mechanics:
- While inside a host, they run in the direction your cursor points in (only works on the latest host). 
- Hold LMB to charge your jump attack. Once you release LMB, you will release from your host and fly in the direction of your cursor to another host.
- You can be inside multiple hosts at the same time.
- Press spacebar to kill all infected hosts and super fling yourself.
- As you kill more humans, you become longer.
- A super fling means no air drag.
- Score is determined based on how many times you fling (less flings is better).
### Negative Mechanics:
- If your head is inside a host, a timer will automatically kill all hosts. This timer resets when you connect to a new host.
- If your head is outside of a host, your life is on a timer.
- You can run into your own body. Running into yourself does **not** end the game.
- The humans run around in unpredictable ways. If you connect to too many of them, you can become tangled up and unable to go further.
### Levels
- Each level is made up of a starting host, healthy hosts, and obstacles.
- The level ends when either all the humans are dead or you're dead.
